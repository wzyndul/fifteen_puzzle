# Step-by-step explanation:
#
# 1. We start by initializing the open and closed lists. The open list contains only the start node, and the closed list is initially empty.
#
# 2.We also initialize two dictionaries: cost, which contains the cost to reach each node from the start node, and parent,
# which contains the parent node of each node. For the start node, the cost is 0 and the parent is None.
#
# 3.We enter a loop that continues until the open list is empty.
#
# 4.In each iteration of the loop, we get the node with the lowest cost from the open list. We use a function h to estimate
# the remaining cost from the current node to the goal node. We add the estimated cost to the cost to reach the current node to get the total cost. This is used to select the node with the lowest total cost.
#
# 5. If the current node is the goal node, we have found a path from the start node to the goal node. We construct the path by
# following the parent pointers from the goal node to the start node, and then reverse the path to get the correct order. We return the path.
#
# 6. If the current node is not the goal node, we move it from the open list to the closed list.
#
# 7.We loop through the neighbors of the current node.
#
# 8.If a neighbor has already been evaluated (i.e., it is in the closed list), we skip it and move on to the next neighbor.
#
# 9.We calculate the tentative cost to reach the neighbor node by adding the cost to reach the current node to the cost
# to move from the current node to the neighbor node.
#
# 10.If the neighbor is not in the open list, or if the tentative cost is lower than the current cost to reach the
# neighbor, we update the cost and parent dictionaries for the neighbor node.
#
# 11.If the neighbor node is not already in the open list, we add it to the open list.
#
# 12.After all neighbors of the current node have been processed, we repeat the loop until the open list is empty.
#
# 13.If the loop completes without finding a path to the goal node, we return None to indicate that no path was found.
#
# Overall, the A* algorithm works by using heuristics to guide the search for the shortest path from the start node to
# the goal node. It uses a combination of the cost to reach each node and an estimate of the remaining cost to the goal
# node to determine which nodes to explore next. By exploring nodes with lower total cost first, it is able to find an
# optimal path from the start node to the goal node.
